I'm going to be tutoring teachers out with this app and it has multiple ways of contact, 

there is a email form to become a teacher and a form to actually schedule an appointment with the individual teacher. 

THE BASICS 

when you get into the website you can do a quick look over which teacher's description looked good. 
when you click on the teacher that you think looks good you go into their show page giving you a little insight on what they are good at and what they can help you out with . 
From that page they have their link to schedule an appointment with all prices for them. 
You will have to login to schedule any appointments with teachers 
STUDENT TEACHERS 
The second page is for people trying to save a little bit of money but also want to learn about SE.
they have the same basic pages as the regular Teachers but with a lower cost, you can still schedule and still ask them about their individual skills if you want to learn more about them.
there is also a page that will link you to a form if you want to edit "YOUR STUDENT PAGE" which is if you are a student teacher you can edit your skills to your liking better. That will all have to be handled by an admin you can't change your individual skills yourself.
there is a student form you can fill out also that will let you become a student teacher if you want to, you fill the form out and then it will email the admins and the admins can change everything on your page to your liking including pictures to upload. 


Footer 
I have a footer with every link that I used on my project such as CSS and some links to W3 schools and other people that helped out. Including honerable mentions,
